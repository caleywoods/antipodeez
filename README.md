Use your current location to show the [antipode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes) (diametrically opposed location) location on Earth.

Some fun facts about antipodes:

* Only 15% of the land in the world has an antipode that is also land. This is caused by the large amount of oceans on Earth and also that
  most of the land mass is contained in the "Land Hemisphere" (north of the equater).

* Within the continental United States, only Colorado and Montana have land opposite them. Almost all of the North American
  continent lays within empty waters of the Indian Ocean. Colorado has some land southeast of Lamar that has an antipode of an island named
  Ile Amsterdam. Near Firstview, Colorado has an antipode of an island named Ile Saint-Paul. The town of Rudyard, Montana is likely the
  only town in the US that sits on top of a non-oceanic antipode  which is Kerguelen Island. These islands are largely unhinhabited.

* Hawaii is antipodal to parts of Botswana in Africa.

* Far northern Alaska has some land which falls opposite coastal Antarctica.

* The largest population centers that have largely populated areas opposite them is China which has antipodes landing in Argentina, Chile,
  Paraguay, and Uruguay. New Zealand has antipodes in Spain.

* New Zealand and France are tied for the largest number of countries touched by its antipodes with 12 countries.
